Have 2 functions
One to serperate the chars and another to compare
If the length is zero... its a palindrome
Otherwise, make the variable tracking the length subtract one and on to the next function.
S always equal 0 when entering the function so if n = 0,l its a pal
Compare s to e and subtract one from e and add one to s to see if the stuff is actually the same on both sides.
